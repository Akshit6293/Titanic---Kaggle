I have used random forest and artificial neaural network. I used Kears library for tensor flow - backend.
I have done Exploratory data analysis on the dataset nusing seaborn library and matplotlib library. 
I have also imputed the null values and dropped the unnecessary columns from my code. 

Feel free to check the approach and kindly point out any improvements.
Thanks
